### Abstract Method
It is a method used in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and defined in an abstract class or interface but does not have an implementation. Instead, the actual implementation of the method is executed in the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.

### Asynchronous  Programming
Async programming gives a feeling of concurrency while using a single thread in a single process. It allows a program to continue executing other tasks without waiting for others.

### Binary Search
It is a search algorithm worked over a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It works based on the comparison between the middle element and narrows the search range. It has a time complexity of O(log n). 
It includes a unit-test function.

### Bubble Sort
It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Its time complexity is O(n^2). It includes a unit-test function.

### fibonacci sequence
It can be calculated in two ways, iterative and recursive, where both are addressed in the code. In mathematical format, it is shown as:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

### Merge Sort
It divides the unsorted list to sort them and then merges the sorted sublists. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

### Selection Sort
Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted part of the list and moves it to the beginning of the sorted list. Its time complexity is O(n^2).
