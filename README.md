# Sample-Code-for-Test

This repository is created to cover some of the common software engineering interview questions. All codes are written in the Python language.

### Binary Search
It is a search algorithm worked over a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It works based on the comparison between the middle element and narrows the search range. It has a time complexity of O(log n). 
It includes a unit-test function.

### Bubble Sort
It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Its time complexity is O(n^2). It includes a unit-test function.

### fibonacci sequence
It can be calculated in two ways, iterative and recursive, where both are addressed in the code. In mathematical format, it is shown as:
F(0) = 0,
F(1) = 1,
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

### Merge Sort
It divides the unsorted list to sort them and then merges the sorted sublists. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

### Selection Sort
Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted part of the list and moves it to the beginning of the sorted list. Its time complexity is O(n^2).

### Abstract Method
It is a method used in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and defined in an abstract class or interface but does not have an implementation. Instead, the actual implementation of the method is executed in the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.

### Asynchronous Programming
Async programming gives a feeling of concurrency while using a single thread in a single process. It allows a program to continue executing other tasks without waiting for others.

### Multi-threading 
Multi-threading is when multiple threads within a single process execute different tasks concurrently. 

### Mulit-processing
In multi-processing each processor has one assigned CUP/core. Processes are started with start(), and with join() wait for all processes to complete.

### Parking Lot Problem
A parking lot logic is implemented using Object-oriented priciples

### Prime number Problem
Figure out if the number is prime or not.
